This is the final cpu simulator project for CS104 in code academy. 

I took the example project from the website and added a few more instruction methods.

I also added a method to "read" the instructions into a binary string and display everything as though the computer was processing the instructions from assembly to machine lanaugage. 

Lastly, it prints the final values from the CPU's 8 registers. 

Overall, it works, but if you start adding more instructions to cpu.py, it gets buggy.

Thank you for the sample project to build off of!
